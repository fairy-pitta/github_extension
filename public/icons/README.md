# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

For now, placeholder icons are referenced in `manifest.json`. In production, you should create proper icons representing the GitHub Dashboard Extension.
